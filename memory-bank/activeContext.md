# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Setting up Java Spring Boot desktop application
- Implementing bus ticket booking system
- Creating PostgreSQL database schema
- Generating sample data for demonstration

## Recent Changes
- Defined project scope and requirements
- Selected technology stack (Java Spring Boot, JavaFX, PostgreSQL)
- Created system architecture documentation
- Established development patterns and guidelines

## Next Steps
1. Initialize Spring Boot project with Maven
2. Set up PostgreSQL database and connection
3. Create entity models and repositories
4. Implement JavaFX UI components
5. Generate and load sample data
6. Implement core booking functionality
7. Add order history tracking

## Active Decisions
- Using Java 17 LTS for development
- JavaFX for desktop UI implementation
- Local PostgreSQL database for data storage
- Spring Boot as the primary framework
- Maven for dependency management

## Important Patterns
- MVC architecture for clean separation of concerns
- Repository pattern for data access
- Service layer for business logic
- DTO pattern for data transfer
- Observer pattern for UI updates

## Project Insights
- Desktop application requires careful UI/UX consideration
- Sample data should cover various booking scenarios
- Local database simplifies prototype development
- Modular design will facilitate future enhancements

## Notes
- Focus on core functionality for prototype
- Maintain clean architecture for future expansion
- Document all development decisions
- Keep security considerations in mind
- This document will be updated frequently to reflect current work
- All active work and decisions should be documented here
- This serves as the primary reference for current project state
